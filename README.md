Choice Property
===============

**What is?**

Choice Property (for Java) allows one to choose a property depending on the
input. It helps translation engines in the pluralization definition.

**How?**

The syntax is pretty simple. Look at the following example:

	(0) No items | (1) One item | ]1, INF[ {0} items

It works almost like `String.format` with one extra argument (the count
argument).

	ChoiceProperty.choiceFormat(<count>, <message>, <opt. args>)

For example:

	int count = 20;
	String message = "(0) No items | (1) One item | ]1, Inf[ {0} items";
	String choice = ChoiceProperty.choiceFormat(count, message, count);
	System.out.println(choice);

The above example will output:

	20 items

Choice Property also allows unique sentences, so it's compatible with
`String.format`. For example:

	String message = "No choice to make{0}";
	String choiceResult = ChoiceProperty.choiceFormat(0, message, "!");
	String formatResult = String.format(message, "!");

Both `choiceResult` and `formatResult` will be the same.
